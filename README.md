## Motivation
FilecoinInterface is a simple interfacing DApp for the Filecoin network. The goal is to allow anybody to easily store, pay for long-term persistence, and retreive their data from IPFS using Filecoin as the payment layer. 

## Design
FilecoinInterface uses web3.storage to store on Filecoin, and allows logging in with your wallet (using Unstoppable Naming Services) to allow for payment.
